# Deep-Learning-Begginer-to-advanecd
tensors , Neutral Networks, computer vision , Rank, Axes , shape 
Here is the Boot Camp Files that i have participated in Deep learning which is Conducted  DPHI is a Open Source Data Science Community 
There in the Boot camp They Started from Basics
like what is a Tensor ,rank of tenosr ,dimensions, shape , size .. etc
Module one is all about ==> Introduction to Deep Learning introduction to Tensors and their Baisc Operations
Module two is all about ==> Multi-Layer Neural Network  and Multi-Layer  Perceptron and Neural Network of Regression
Module Three is all about ==> Neural Networks for Classification Problems
Module Four is all about ==>  Neural Networks for Regression Problems
Module Five is all  about ==> Optimisizing a the Neural Networks and Loss  Fuctions , call backs, Metrics, epochs and Indepth Feature Handling
Module Six is all about  ==> Digital Image Processing(  Image  pre processing operations grey,rgb,edge sharping,edge detection , black and white.. etc)
Module Seven is all about ==> Convolution Neural Network Introduction 
Moduel Eight is all about ==> Good Introduction about GAN


you  can find the above files reagarding the each and every module thank you
